    "where $u(t, x)$ is the velocity field, $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity, and $t$ and $x$ are time and space variables, respectively. The domain is defined as $t \\in [0, T]$ and $x \\in [-1, 1]$ with initial conditions $u(0, x) = -\\sin(\\pi x)$ and Dirichlet boundary conditions $u(-1,t)=u(1,t)=0$. We will only consider kinematic viscosity $\\nu = 10^{-2}/\\pi$.\n",

    "The first three methods are inspired by the paper \"Spectral and finite difference solutions of the Burgers equation\" by Basdevant, C. et al. Comput. Fluids 14, 23 (1986). This paper will be referenced as Basdevant1986 in the following.\n",

    "We use the convolution form from Cole's transformation like Basdevant1986. We assume initial conditions $u(x,0) = -\\sin{(\\pi x)}$. The solution is expressed as\n",
